// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step. In this step you grab everything in the planning step to research and document them in detail. Ideally you gather information from technical, financial, legal, and marketing teams to get an outline for the project."
const design = "This is the third step. The goal is to create a plan to, and to develop each required feature to be implemented later."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step. This is where the plans created in the planning phase are executed. The goal is to create a system that meets all the predetermined requirements."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step. This phase is meant to ensure that the system created in the implementation phase meets customer requirements. You also test that the system works as expected and doesn't have any bugs."
const maintain = "This is the final step. Once the product is developed and released, this step is meant to support the current customers. Keeping the system working as expected and fixing problems that may arrise in the long run."
